This tool is designed to test all of the templates located in the https://github.com/pufferpanel/templates repo
and ensure all templates run (to the best of it's abilities) and that they can produce relatively functional
servers.

It is not able to test templates that require true user input, such as passwords or 3rd party registrations.
